    <h2 class="highlight">The Story behind HTML</h2>
    <p class="post-text">HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. Long before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, 
        each version has allowed its user to create web pages in a much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient.</p>

    <h2 class="highlight">Vannevar Bush and HTML</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Vannevar Bush was an engineer born at the end of the 19th century. By the 1930s he was working on analog computers and in 1945 wrote the article "As We May Think," 
        published in the Atlantic Monthly. In it, he describes a machine he called memex, which would store and retrieve information via microfilm. It would consist of screens (monitors), 
        a keyboard, buttons, and levers. The system he discussed in this article is very similar to HTML, and he called the links between various pieces of information associative trails. 
        This article and theory laid the foundation for Tim Berners-Lee and others to invent the World Wide Web, HTML (hypertext markup language), HTTP (HyperText 
        Transfer Protocol), and URLs (Universal Resource Locators) in 1990. Bush died in 1974 before the web existed or the internet became widely known, but his discoveries were seminal.</p>
    

        <h2 class="highlight">Tim Berners-Lee and HTML</h2>
    <p class="post-text">Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist and academic, was the primary author of HTML, with the assistance of his colleagues at CERN, an international scientific organization based in Geneva. 
        Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN. He was named one of Time magazine's 100 most important people of the 20th century for this accomplishment.</p>
        <p class="post-text"><p class="post-text">Berners-Lee's browser editor was developed in 1991-92. This was a true browser editor for the first version of HTML and ran on a NeXt workstation. 
            Implemented in Objective-C, it, made it easy to create, view, and edit web documents. The first version of HTML was formally published in June 1993.</p>

    
         <h2 class="highlight">Timeline of the HTML</h2>
         <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <li>HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. 
                But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.</li>
            <li>Then comes HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with a few additional features, 
                which remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.</li>
            <li>Then comes HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful 
                characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of the new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.</li>
            <li>Then comes HTML 4.01, which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide.
                 HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.</li>
          </ul>
