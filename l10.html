    <h2 class="highlight">The Connection between the three</h2>
    <p class="post-text">For some of us, the thought of designing a website from scratch can seem like a really daunting task. The irony of it is that for most of us, websites 
        form part of our daily life. The same way the internet connects us, there are special web languages that work together to make up the internet and the websites it contains. 
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together to form the front-end design of a website by applying information that affects content, style and interactivity of a site.</p>

    <h2 class="highlight">So there’s more than just one web language?</h2>
    <p class="post-text">There are many web languages available, however we’re just going to look at three of them. They are HTML, CSS and JavaScript and they are considered to be the backbone of the web. 
        When it comes to web development there is front-end web development and back end-web development. These three languages are for front-end web development and are responsible for what you can see and do on a website. 
        They are referred to as client side languages as they run in the browser (Google Chrome, Firefox etc.) of your computer. The browser translates these languages and the result of this translation is the visual web page.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="post-text">It’s important to note HTML and CSS are not considered to be programming languages. HTML is a markup language and CSS is a styling language. JavaScript, however, 
        is a programming language. Hence, they are all web languages, but they perform different jobs.</p>
    <br>
        <p class="post-text"><p class="post-text">For those that are new to web design the easiest way to understand this relationship is to look at an analogy that will break it down into bite-size chunks. One way to look at 
            front-end web development is to see these three languages interact with one another the same way a human body interacts with its surroundings.</p>

    
         <h2 class="highlight">The Website as a Human Body</h2>
         <p class="post-text">To make this easy to understand, I’m going to refer to these three web languages as different aspects of the human body. 
            We’re going to look at the body itself as a sort of command centre; the accessories that are worn on the body as a way of representing personal 
            style; and then the actions that the body is capable of as a way of animating ourselves. So for the purpose of this discussion, HTML will be referred 
            to as the physical body, CSS will be the body’s accessories and JavaScript is the body’s ability to talk or move. All of these ‘bodily aspects’ 
            need to work together to form a functional, visually appealing, interactive website.</p>
